      <p style="text-align:justify"><br>“Be it a man or a woman, all have the ability. The difference is how the ability is used!”
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Being the daughter of a great renowned poet Lord Byron, She just wrote some code on a piece of paper. And that piece of paper took the greatest place in  the history of “Computer Science”.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Yes! The first one to recognize the full potential of a “Computing Machine” and one of the “First Programmer” is a woman and she is none other than “Ada Lovelace”.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">In spite of all the odds she faced in her life, she has never lost hope and perseverance in her work. She is also well known for her note’s on Babbage’s Analytical engine. Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to notice. She recognized that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.

	  <br><p style="text-align:justify">In fairness, Lovelace’s program is not easy to explain to the layperson without some hand-waving. It’s the intricacies of her program, though, that make it so remarkable.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop. She realized how important it was to track the state of variables as they changed, introducing a notation to illustrate those changes.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">So let’s take a closer look at Lovelace’s program for calculating the Bernoulli numbers. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">The program is essentially a list of operations, specified using the usual mathematical symbols. <br>Her program calculated a number that she called B7, which modern mathematicians known as the eighth Bernoulli number. Her program thus sought to solve the following equation:<br><strong>B7=−1(A0+B1A1+B3A3+B5A5)</strong>
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">In the above, each term represents a coefficient in the polynomial formula for the sum of integers to a particular power. Here that power is eight, since the eighth Bernoulli number first appears in the formula for the sum of positive integers to the eighth power. The B and A numbers represent the two kinds of factors that Bernoulli discovered.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">B1 through B7 are all different Bernoulli numbers, indexed according to Lovelace’s indexing. A0 through A5 represent the factors of the coefficients that Bernoulli could calculate using Pascal’s Triangle. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">The values of A0, A1, A3, and A5 appear below. Here n represents the index of the Bernoulli number in the sequence of odd-numbered Bernoulli numbers starting with the first. Lovelace’s program used n = 4.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Lovelace’s program first calculates A0 and the product B1A1. It then enters a loop that repeats twice to calculate B3A3 and B5A5, since those are formed according to an identical pattern. After each product is calculated, it is added with all the previous products, so that by the end of the program the full sum has been obtained.
