      <p><p style="text-align:justify">Although blockchain is in its infancy, India is pacing towards its adoption considering the serious requirement of it in our nation. In simple terms, blockchain is an ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Think of it as a database, but instead of storing a single version of the database on one computer or server, everyone involved in the blockchain has their own copy.<br><strong><br>INDIA IS GROWING DIGITAL!</strong>
	  <br><p style="text-align:justify">With the large scale successful adoption of digital payments like google pay, paytm, etc., India is now keen on moving towards adopting blockchain. Unable to ignore the truth that India is captivated in the palms of corruption since decades, and none of the government has been able to remove the menace, we seek the help of technology to do so .

	  <br><p style="text-align:justify">With transparency being an important asset as the information on every transaction is publicly available to everyone on the blockchain, this  technology has lessened the chance for corruption. In light to this, Banks in India like SBI, Axis, ICICI were quick to realize the opportunities of blockchain for efficient banking operations. Block chain technology has managed to establish itself in many Indian sectors like the health insurance ,banking, government sector ,RBI and tax authorities, despite all the hurdles.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">The major hindrance in adopting block chain was the lack of awareness. It is definitely a good sign that even with its discomfort with the cryptocurrency, India promotes the launch of digital currency through blockchain. Keeping all the risks and uncertainties aside it can be guaranteed that blockchain will contribute to a revolutionary change in India.
