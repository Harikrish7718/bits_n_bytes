      <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Before knowing about what cyber security actually is, we must first understand it’s need and importance in this highly competitive digitalized world. We live in an age where almost everyone’s life is locked inside small electronic gadgets. We completely depend on them from our morning alarm, storing confidential data to entertainment.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Even a small mistake in securing data or bad social networking can prove to be extremely dangerous. If accounts are not properly secured ,It becomes easier for hackers or unauthorized users to spread viruses thereby stealing data and even money. Today, due to high internet penetration in almost everyone’s life, cyber security is one of the biggest need of the world as cyber threats are very dangerous. Cyber security refers to protecting confidential data from unauthorized access. There are two possible threats: cyber crime and cyber warfare.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Using cyberspace(computers, internet etc.) to commit a crime is known as cyber crime. It is probably done by an individual or by an organization. Cyber warfare includes hacking vital information, webpages and intelligence of a country. In near future, wars may not be like the traditional ones. Internet will act as a potential weapon against another nation which is inevitable.

Some of the measures that could be taken are changing passwords regularly, deleting unused accounts, installing proper anti-virus softwares, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping our softwares up to date.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Not only the government but also the citizens should spread awareness among the people. Youth can play a major role in this regard. Growing cyber threats such as data theft, phishing scams and other cyber vulnerabilities demand that users should remain vigilant about protecting data. It is essential to understand varied type of risks.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">Knowledge about cyber security laws is mandatory for every person using internet.
