      <img src="miniproj.jpg" style="width:640px;height:360px;">
      <p><br><p style="text-align:justify">The Electricity Bill Calculator is based on the tariff set by the TNEB. Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (abbreviated as TNEB) is a power generation and distribution company owned by Government of Tamil Nadu, India. TNEB was formed on 1 July 1957 as the Madras State Electricity Board according to the Electricity Supply Act of 1948 as a successor to the erstwhile Electricity Department of the Government of Madras under the authority of the Department of Power. 
      <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">It was responsible for electricity generation, distribution and transmission, and it regulated the electricity supply in the state. Later it was renamed Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. In October 2008, the Government of Tamil Nadu decided to divide TNEB into two subsidiaries. On 1 November 2010, TNEB Limited became a holding company with two subsidiaries, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO), responsible for power generation, and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO), responsible for power transmission.
	  <br><br><br>OBJECTIVE OF THE APP:
	  <br><p style="text-align:justify">The main objective of the app is to create a replica of the TNEB bill calculator. Also, electricity tariff rates were part of our syllabus, so developing this app helped us to understand, evaluate and implement the concept of tariff rates very clearly. 
	  <br><br><br>ABOUT THE APP:
      <br><p style="text-align:justify">The app (Electricity Bill Calculator) is based on Event Drive Programming concept and is built with the help of “MIT App Inventor 2”.  The app calculates the amount of money to be paid (based on the latest domestic tariff released by the TNEB) when the consumed units is entered. The app works only in Android devices and also in PCs if there is an Android Emulator like Bluestacks, Andy etc. installed in it.
	  <br><br><br>STILL WORKING:			       
	  <br><p style="text-align:justify">The app calculates the bill only for domestic tariff in both billing cycle (Monthly and Bi-Monthly). Our aim is to update the app so that it works for all the tariff check provided by the TNEB.</p>
