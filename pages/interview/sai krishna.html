          <h4>ITC Infotech</h4>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          <br><p><strong><h3>Round 1 :</h3></strong> 
          <br>This round had multiple choice questions which included quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, verbal and technical MCQ’s from C, C++, Java, DBMS, networking. 
          <br><br>This round had a stipulated time slot and it section wise time constraint was there and questions were of easy and average level.
		  <br><br>There were around 60 questions and almost all who got above 45 and above was shortlisted for the next level.
		  </p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong><h3>Round 2 :</h3></strong>
          <br>This round was generally a group discussion round during the previous years of ITC recruitment. This time they kept it as a technical interview. The questions were all from the topics and subjects which I had mentioned in my resume. 
		  <br>There were very basic questions such as <br>•	What is  the difference between operator overloading and overriding?<br>•	Inheritance in real time and what are the types of inheritance?
		  <br><br>The questions were rapid when it came to my project. I did my project based on DBMS. They asked almost all kinds of basic questions regarding my project. I did it using relational DBMS. 
		  <br><br>In the end, He was impressed by the way I expressed all the ideas clearly and effectively..and he mentioned that this trait is an asset which stands out from other candidates… <br><br>I was asked to wait for the final HR Round.
		  <br><br>The question was like why not I didn’t do with current technology instead I did with SQL+. I answered that since my curriculum had relational DBMS I made immense use of that to finish my project. Then, the interviewer asked me to write some small programs like finding the EMI to be paid for the ‘n’th month, basic programs like Armstrong number. They will just see how you arrive at the solution and your thought process and not the exact code. But it is good that if we ask some time and do the best as we can. 
		  <br><br>I was selected for the HR round.
		  <hr>
		  <strong><h3> Round 3 :</h3></strong>
		  <br>This was a Personal interview. It’s always good if you give a firm handshake to the interviewer if he extends his hand for handshake. The interviewer asked me to walk through the resume. I gave my self intro and as I was sure of the contents in my resume I just said the stuffs in it. He asked me what’s the role of data in the world. I said data makes those which we think impossible possible in this real world. Example: Digital Currency. He then asked me whether the emerging technology will replace humans in the future. I said Engineering is based on providing solutions to problems  and since every problem has a solution.So in case there is a such a situation, then it will be considered as a problem by the engineers and a solution will be definitely arrived at it. He then asked me whether I have any questions for him. I asked regarding the area on which their main domain is focused and he gave a  firm handshake and the round was ended. After sometime I was announced that I was selected.<br>
		  <br>We need not be tensed  during the technical and HR interviews. Just a firm attitude and polite but confident answering to their questions  will show them we are capable.
		  <br><br>Mentioning your Curricular activities and extra-curricular activities will help attracting the interviewer sometimes.(not all the times). I mentioned regarding music in my resume. Luckily, the technical interviewer was a music passionate person. So we had almost music related conversation for 3 minutes. But it wasn’t the same for other companies which I attended. It might help.
		  <br>•	Practice Aptitude questions well.<br>•	 Practice self intro at least twice or thrice before the interviews.<br>•	 Communicate clearly.<br>•	Stay neutral while you in Group Discussions.<br>•	 Prepare well. <br>•	Hard work and smart work will help us succeed.
