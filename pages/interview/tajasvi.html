          <br><br>This is an pen and paper written test round.The test consisted three sections.
		  <br><br>More weightage is given for coding section.It had three questions based on data structures.

		  <p><strong><h3>Round 2 :</h3></strong>
          <br>This is an face to face technical interview.Answer Sheet of first round written test was with the interviewer. After self introduction the interviewer went straight into the coding section answer in my answer sheet and asked to explain the approach.And asked for techniques to optimize that further.
		  <br>Then the next question is a coding problem in data structure(to find whether a linked list is palindrome or not).I purposely started with a O(n^2) solution and step by step gave an optimised solution.For that optimised solution he gave an appreciation.
		  <br><br>Next he looked into my resume and enquired about the academic projects.And next he asked about my SQL skills.Gave few questions to solve based on joins.(eg:Find the name of second least salary of an employee given three tables)
		  <br><br>And switched to questions related to my area of interest.Followed by some basic questions in OS (virtual memory,trashing,context switching,booting).
		  <br><br>Next he enquired about the latest trends in web development.I gave some explanations regarding async implementations.And he enquired about my knowledge in react.I addmitted that I haven't used that till now but I assured that I can learn quick.
		  <br><br>Finally 'he asked do you have any questions?'.I asked him 'if I am going to be a part of 247.ai what is that I should learn to contribute my best to the organization?'.He then replied to learn java in depth and also learn about nosql databases.
		  <br><br>I added that I have another question.'What will be my role in the organization immediately after joining as an intern?'.He replied that I will be assigned to an ongoing live project and will be considered as active member of the organization.
