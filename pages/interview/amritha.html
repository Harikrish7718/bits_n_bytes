          <br><p><strong><h3>Round 1 :</h3></strong> 
          <br>This was an online round. 
          <br><br>This round had coding questions and MCQâ€™s on aptitude, C, C++, OS, networking.
		  <br><br>The coding questions were from moderate to difficult levels.
		  </p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong><h3>Round 2 :</h3></strong>
          <br>This was a face to face interview, here all the questions were purely based on the project done in college and my confidence was evaluated. 
		  <hr>
		  <strong><h3> Round 3 :</h3></strong>
		  <br>This was also a face to face interview. 
		  <br><br>But this round was a bit tricky than the previous round, here I was given a DBMS question and was asked to form a solution for it. 
		  <br><br>The panelists were interested in knowing my way of approaching the problem rather than an exact solution. In this round, my attitude was put to test. They evaluated my capacity to work in a team and my stress management skills. 
		  <hr>
		  <strong><h3> Final Round :</h3></strong>
		  <br>This was the HR round. In this round, I was encouraged to ask questions to the panelist regarding CISCO and their culture.  
		  <br><br>Finally I got placed and my overall placement experience with CISCO was an enjoyable roller coaster ride.
