		  <br><br>There was another person on Skype who explained that they hire for Digital Solutions, So what new digital technologies which I am aware of.  I said Cloud, IoT, ML, DL. He asked me what each of these is with a basic example. Then he asked whether any of my projects is related with these technologies.  I explained one of my projects which was on ANN. He asked what a neural network is and what kind of network I used in the project. With this, technical interview came to an end. He asked questions from my side, where I asked the latest Digital project which he is working with.
		  <br><br>HR told that this was just a formality and asked questions like unique reason for them to hire me. He listed things like passionate learner, team worker and I should not repeat that. He gave a scenario and asked whether you will be available for working night shifts. I told yes provided I can gain and have scope of growth. Interview went for about 40 mins.
