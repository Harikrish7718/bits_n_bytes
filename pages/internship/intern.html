      <p style="text-align:justify">We have completed our internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai from 6th November 2019 to 26th December 2019 on 5G NR Packet Data Convergence Protocol L2 Stack. We were assigned to develop an API for the Data PDU part of Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP). PDCP is a sub layer of the L2 stack that performs header compression, Ciphering, Integrity Protection and t-Reordering with a control module that manages the flow of payload during uplink and the downlink. We succeeded in building the API with all the specified requirements as per Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) specification (3GPP TS 38.323 version 15.2.0 Release 15).
      <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">We had a great experience working in the research area where we understood how new technologies are being developed. We also learnt how to approach the problems from different perspectives to predict all possible solutions, analyse and implement the most optimal solution and then improvise to make it more efficient and scalable. We started with understanding the technical specification, listed out all the tasks to be performed, planned a schedule with completion time for each task(header compression, Ciphering, Integrity Protection and t-Reordering , a control module, and testing module using pcap).  After completing the implementation of individual modules, we integrated them with the control module to build an API. We then tested the performance of the API real time data using packet capturing. The results were satisfactory. We were appreciated for our remarkable work with a short time span.

      <p style="text-align:justify">My first internship â€˜experience has been very rewarding because I have acquired and learned new skills. This internship has enriched my knowledge in the processor verification field. I certainly know that I know more now than I did before I started my internship .In my internship, I was placed at the verification tool customization department. This department is where people personalize  the processor verification tools available in the market for RISC-V processor . This department also has to manage to unify all the verification tools into  a virtual envirointment, so that all the tools can execute concurrently . My job responsibilities included customisation of RISC-V dv (A verification tool) and maintaining the code repository. My main objective and goal for this internship was to learn all about processor verification, however in order to do so, I had to ask a lot of questions and get along with my co-interns, so I could learn from them.</p>
      <br><p style="text-align:justify">Here is a summary of what I have done during the internship .
	   <br><br><p style="text-align:justify">The Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture is a free and open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. It directly challenges several well-established processor families such as intel x-86, Motorola 68k processor. For the RISC-V ecosystem to thrive, core suppliers need an independent verification solution to ensure that their designs are compliant with the ISA specification. Verification of RISC-V designs is especially challenging because of optional features, implementation flexibility, and provisions for customer extensions. Hence thorough verification is essential to compete successfully against the established processor families. Automation is the key to reduce the time taken in the verification of the processor. This work provides a way to develop an automated tool(ATPG) which helps in verifying the processor in an efficient way,  by seamlessly generating test program to test the processor using python.
