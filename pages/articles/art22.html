      <p style="text-align:justify;"><br>A team of three people had designed a unique 'GOAWAY Tags', a smart band which helps to identify COVID patients and can also be used for people under quarantine. This band contains nanosensors designed using MEMS technology, that helps to detect the symptoms of COVID-19, and can also be used in future for other pandemics too, which helps individuals quarantine themselves and practice social distancing. 
      <br><br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">This tag is helpful to detect basic symptoms of the virus, like increased body temperature and shortness of breath. The Redlight symbolises that the individual is being affected by the virus. When a person ties this band to his hands, he will not be able to remove it without damaging the lock. A small battery fitted can support it for  45 days. In case if the infected persons walk out of the house, public or police can detect them easily with the help of beacons and can immediately take them to quarantine.

	  <br><p style="text-align:justify;">The temperature monitor system with nanosensor in the tags will give the indication and past history of the person wearing it. A history of the last 96 hours gives an indication on what to do next. This band would cost around Rs 100 to Rs 150. These tags are in the form of waterproof bands which are tied to the hands of the people, who come from different countries from the airport, and also for localities who travel daily via metro, bus and train.  
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">A senior engineer further explaining the features of the 'Goaway' said: 'The Tags will have Bluetooth5 based beacons and tracking. It keeps storing the details of movement and body temperature of the person, uploads the same when the person comes near a beacon monitor. Beacon monitors can be placed at places where crowding happens, will detect the nearby beacons and inform/alert the concerned about the movement of the person. Meanwhile, embedded tampering detect will keep a record of it and update the same to the beacon monitor when it comes closer to it.‚Äù
