      <p style="text-align:justify;"><br>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that range from the common cold to MERS coronavirus, which is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and SARS, (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced countries to use every trick in the book to contain the disease.  Asian countries have used a wide range of technologies in their fight against the pandemic. This article recounts how China uses AI and Big Data to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak.
	  <h2>Introduction</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Smart imaging is one of the tech tools being deployed in China.  In an effort to enable contactless and rapid temperature detection, China is using AI-powered thermal cameras to identify those in a crowd who have a fever. The country is also deploying facial-recognition systems to identify those not wearing masks.  Infrared thermometers are now used in most subway stations in China to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus. </p>

	  <br><h2>Implementation</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">Megviiâ€™s R&D team proposed an AI-enabled temperature detection solution that integrates body detection, face detection and dual sensing via infrared cameras and visible light. The system is designed to help staff working at locations with high-density passenger flows, such as train stations, bus stations, railway stations and airports, to swiftly identify people who may have elevated body temperatures.
	  <br><br>An artificial intelligence (AI) based fever screening system developed by the Beijing-based company Megvii Technology Limited is being implemented in many stations. The system supports non-contact remote temperature screening from a distance of 3 meters.
	  <br><br>Those people are then located in the crowd using available body and facial information. This allows staff to complete all body temperature screenings without close physical contact, while reducing potential physical transmission of the coronavirus and optimizing passenger flow.
	  <br><br>The thermal scanners are just one of the ways in which authorities are using artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to combat the deadly virus, which has now reached 56 other countries since it was first detected in central China's Hubei Province in late December last year.
      <br><br><h2>Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">The unprecedented challenges that the COVID-19 virus has brought upon governments and societies around the world has already prompted many countries to place much of their hope in the hands of the technology industry.  Emerging technologies are being deployed all across Asia to help fight the coronavirus outbreak. Technologies are becoming key in the struggle to put a lid on the coronavirus pandemic and it can help add an extra layer of infection prevention efforts.</p>
