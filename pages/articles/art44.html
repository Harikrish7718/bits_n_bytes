      <p><br><p style="text-align:justify;">The coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, has spread across the globe with unseen speed and ferocity. The world has been sent into self-isolation in an attempt to curb the spread and major events, including the Tokyo Olympics, have been postponed or canceled. Health authorities and governments are attempting to flatten the curve and mitigate extensive transmission in the community, while scientists and researchers turn their attention to the coronavirus causing the disease: SARS-CoV-2.
	  Vaccines are incredibly important in the fight against disease. We've been able to keep a handful of viral diseases at bay for decades because of vaccine development. Even so, there exists confusion and unease about their usefulness. This guide explains what vaccines are, why they are so important and how scientists will use them in the fight against the coronavirus. It also discusses the current treatment options being used and those that show promise in hospitals.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">A vaccine is a type of treatment aimed at stimulating the body's immune system to fight against infectious pathogens, like bacteria and viruses. They are, according to the World Health Organization, "one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases."

	  <br><p style="text-align:justify;">The most important ingredient is the antigen. This is the part of the vaccine the body can recognize as foreign. Depending on the type of vaccine, an antigen could be molecules from viruses like a strand of DNA or a protein. It could instead be weakened versions of live viruses as well. A second important ingredient is the adjuvant. An adjuvant works to amplify the immune response to an antigen. Whether a vaccine contains an adjuvant depends on the type of vaccine it is. There can be other ingredients such as preservatives for long storage requirements.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">These vaccines or another form of cure always take extremely long period of time to be used as mainstream drugs. The main reason is to generate the correct antigens for the virus. Also, these cures should not have any major side effects such as rashes and other skin diseases, nausea, headaches, etc. To find these side-effects, all vaccines and antibiotics undergo vigorous testing in animals and in humans for multiple trials. Each trial may extend from a few days to a few weeks. The testing phase may extend for as long as 10 years. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">To formulate nearly perfect antigens, genome sequencing is performed for the virus itself.  This step is thankfully simpler for the COVID-19(SARS-CoV-2), which has 80-90% of DNA of SARS virus first encountered in 2002. 
      <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">The first genome sequencing was performed during the 1970s. At that time, it was a really pain taking human intensive time-consuming task. But now in 2020, the technology has drastically improved. Mainly in the fields of Nano technology, computational biology and many more. AI and ML plays a vital role in genome sequencing as it drastically reduces the time to decode the DNA. Which helps in creation of the antigen much easier. Currently there are ready to use software such as the Microsoft Genomics. Which provide on demand services for sequencing. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">In developing a vaccine, scientists are looking at these projections intensely. The projections enable the virus to enter human cells where it can replicate and make copies of itself. Researchers have been able to map the projections in 3D, and research suggests they could be a viable antigen in any coronavirus vaccine. Some of the most talked about approaches are those using a relatively novel type of vaccine known as a "nucleic acid vaccine." These vaccines are essentially programmable, containing a small piece of genetic code to act as the antigen.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">In the US, Moderna's Phase I clinical trials began on March 16 in collaboration with NIAID, the US National Institutes of Health and KPWHRI. It is the first testing in humans of the mRNA vaccine and will look to enroll a total of 45 healthy adult volunteers aged between 18 and 55 years. "This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal," Fauci said in a statement.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Moderna's approach is particularly unique in its speed. Because the biotech company was already researching ways to tackle the coronavirus which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, they were able to adapt their methodology and vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2. The experimental vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273, contains genetic material from the spike protein present in SARS-CoV-2 embedded within a lipid nanoparticle.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">The trial will see patients receive two injections of the mRNA-1273 28 days apart. The 45 patients will be divided into three groups of 15 and given differing doses. Safety reviews will be performed after the first four patients receive the lowest and middle doses and again before all patients receive their shots. Another safety review of data will be performed before the 15 patients set to receive the highest dose are injected.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Even if the vaccine is proven to be safe and shows promise in protecting against COVID-19, it could still be a year away -- at least.</p>
