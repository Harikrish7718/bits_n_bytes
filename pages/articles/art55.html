	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CORONA</b> : I am 120nm in diameter wise with the diameter of envelope as 80nm and the spikes as 40 nm. Inside the envelope, I have nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on -a-string type confirmation. The liquid bi layer envelope, membrane proteins and the nucleocapsid protects me when I am outside the host cell.

As of 7 April 2020, more than 1.36 million cases have been reported in over 200 countries and territories resulting in approximately 75,900 deaths and more than 2, 91, 000 people have recovered.
