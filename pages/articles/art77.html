      <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID-19 the Corona Virus. The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens with the right information and taking precautions.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Aarogya Setu is a mobile application developed by the Ministry of Electronics and IT to connect essential health services with the people of India in our combined fight against the pandemic. The App is aimed at augmenting the initiatives of the Government of India, particularly the Department of Health, in proactively reaching out to and informing the users of the app regarding risks and relevant advisories pertaining to the containment of COVID-19.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Aarogya Setu tracks through a Bluetooth and GPS generated social graph, your interaction with someone who could have tested positive. You will be alerted if someone you have come in close proximity of, even unknowingly, tests COVID-19 positive. The app alerts are accompanied by instructions on how to self-isolate and what to do in case you develop symptoms.

	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">The app is also built on a platform that can provide Application Programming Interface (API) so that other computer programs, mobile applications and web services can make use of the features and data available of Aarogya Setu.
