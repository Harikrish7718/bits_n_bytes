      <p><br><br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 may be having a devastating impact on our industries, social lives and personal grooming standards, but it is also prompting an outpour of creativity in other aspects. As IT pros around the world go all-out to support a workforce that's suddenly fully remote, many technology workers and companies are joining efforts to alleviate the COVID-19 crisis in different ways, including developing products to combat the virus, to track and predict its spread, and to protect hospitals from cyberattacks.

	  <br><h2>Postman develops COVID-19 testing site with crowdsourced info</h2><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Postman, a San Francisco-based platform for API development, has crafted a website that relies on crowdsourced information to locate coronavirus testing locations in the U.S. "This effort to crowdsource and centralize the availability of COVID-19 testing locations across all 50 U.S states uses two freely available online tools, while using APIs to make sure the location data can be syndicated and distributed as widely as possible," Postman said in a statement. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">"This resource can also maintain the accuracy and freshness of the API’s source data by managing it centrally via Google Sheets. Contributors email the Postman team when they find new or updated testing sites, and API developers can contribute their expertise via the GitHub page."
	  <br><br><h2>Amplify.ai, Messenger team up on AI messaging</h2><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Amplify.ai, that develops AI-driven, conversational virtual assistants, is offering its virtual assistant for free to government health organizations fighting the pandemic. The company partnered with Facebook to allow the organizations to share information with concerned citizens. The company also deployed a COVID-19 virtual assistant for the Indian Government through MyGov, the world’s largest government-to-citizen digital infrastructure, with more than 500 million users. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">“Given the rapid rate of change around the pandemic, Amplify.ai’s Messenger experience can automate responses to commonly asked questions and push information to a large population in a timely manner," the company said in a statement. “Its main focus is to interactively deliver the latest news, expert information and official updates, while providing one-on-one engagements and solutions within 24 hours. The platform uses personalization, custom variables, and conversational data gathering analytics to provide citizens with COVID-19 information regarding test sites, symptoms, results turn-around time, and more." said Amplify.ai CEO and co-founder Mahi de Silva.
	  <br><br><h2>WPI turns to 3D printing to create ventilators during the COVID-19</h2><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, Mass. have been developing designs that could be used with 3D printers to create ventilators from readily available manual, handheld, bag valve mask (BVM) resuscitators. The WPI researchers are making designs of multiple devices and their components publicly available so anyone with a 3D printer and a background in electronics and mechanical engineering could use them to produce ventilators for their local hospitals.<br>
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">"We’re taking things that are used every day in emergency medicine and finding a way to turn them into safe, reliable, and readily replicable ventilators that can save patients’ lives." said Gregory Fischer, professor of robotics and mechanical engineering and director of the PracticePoint Medical Cyber-Physcial Systems R&D Center.
	  <br><br><h2>Coronavirus and space technologies: Satellites to fight with COVID-19!</h2><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Space Technologies have a bit of different context in regards to its utility for addressing global pandemics like COVID-19. The prevailing threat to humanity is so large that there is a need to use every available resource to defeat the virus and there is a need to use the existing satellite networks for this purpose with some novelty. A critical assessment of the medical facilities and mortuaries could be done based on satellite imagery. 
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Various governments are found requiring different types of information for taking decisions to organise various types of activities from imposing quarantine measures to check the movement of migrant labours to ensure the continuing of electricity and water supply to build temporary hospitals on open grounds/stadiums. Satellite imagery and the data collected by satellites are of great assistance to conduct such activities.  Telemedicine is one of the unique applications of Space Technology for societal benefit. Today, with many states a significant amount of shortages in medical staff are visible, particularly when the hospitals are found been overloaded with the patients. This facility allows the doctors in smaller towns and villages with limited expertise to consult the super-specialists in real-time for medical advice. 
	  <br><br><h2>Italian engineers turn snorkeling masks into life-saving ventilators</h2><br><p style="text-align:justify;">While China seems to have dealt with the spread of COVID-19 within its borders, countries like Italy and the US have become the new hot spots for the coronavirus. And as the number of those infected continues to rise, so does the demand for qualified specialists and necessary equipment.Engineers Cristian Fracassi and Alessandro Romaiol of ISINNOVA, an Italian engineering company, were approached by Dr. Renato Favero, former head physician at the Gardone Valtrompia Hospital, with an idea to help mitigate the current shortage of C-PAP masks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">The masks are used by hospitals in sub-intensive therapy. The need for these masks spiked when COVID-19 reached Italy earlier this year. Since these masks are now in short supply, Dr. Favero suggested modifying readily-available scuba diver masks into masks that can be connected to a ventilating machine.It wasn’t long until Decathlon, a sporting goods retailer, was included in the project as an ideator, producer, and supplier of the Easybreath snorkeling mask. ISINNOVA quickly got a hold of the CAD designs, studied them, and made the necessary modifications, including the design and 3D printing of the Charlotte and Dave valves—the connecting part between the mask and the breathing machine tubes.
	  <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">ISINNOVA wrote that the prototype was tested on one of their colleagues inside Chiari Hospital and the test was a success. The hospital itself also tested the device on a patient in need and the new modified ventilation mask passed the test with flying colors.
